created a user controller and model for new users. Includes validation requirements for name and email.

Added structure to user model, index, so that when searching for a users uniqueness we do not need to do a full-table scan. Instead only the index needs to be scanned.

"The method for authenticating users will be to take a submitted password, hash it, and compare the result to the hashed value stored in the database. If the two match, then the submitted password is correct and the user is authenticated. By comparing hashed values instead of raw passwords, we will be able to authenticate users without storing the passwords themselves. This means that, even if our database is compromised, our usersâ€™ passwords will still be secure." from railstuturial.org

added bcrypt to gemfile to prevent attacker from logging into site.
